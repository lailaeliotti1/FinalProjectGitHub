 # LAILA'S MAGIC JUKEBOX
 
 This is Laila's Magic Jukebox program! This program will take in the user's favorite genre out of the four choices and
return a list of songs as they are currently playing. The user also has the option to choose how long the playlist will 
 be.

Please download all of the music files to make sure that the music will play. To start, run the main file, 
enter one of the chosen genres exactly as they are listed when running the file.
The playlist should start playing after an opening magical sound.When choosing a playlist's length, keep in mind of how
many mp3 files are in the genre's folder.
To end the playlist, stop running the program.

This is my Intro to CS Final Project that I completed on November 14th, 2021.
